# **Arduino RC 6CH Radio control wiki!**

This project has been released for upgrading hardware/software     
of cheap **FS-CT6B HK-T6A** RC transmitters or if you want upgrade any other 6CH RC transmitter.    
Sincerely... I'm not true Arduino or C code developer but only a geek who wants to learn!    
    
**Are welcome anyone want optimize this code.**   
   
**The Arduino code is derived from another good project in this RCGroups thread**    
**[ArduTX project link](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1817699-Hobbyking-6ch-tx-arduino-computer-update)**    

**If you want discuss this project I have already open thread on RCGroups**    
**[Arduino RC6 CH link](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2959179-Arduino-radio-for-HK-T6A-or-Flysky-FS-CT6B-(ArduTX-rebirth))** 

***
The code has been modified to work with **SH1106 SPI 1.3"** or **SSD1306 SPI 0.96"** OLED display     
**through U8g2 library [UG2 Github link](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino)**   
- Recommended **[Arduino IDE 1.8.2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)** or above seems to be optimized and stable compiler    
less Flash and RAM used and tested with Arduino AVR Boards 1.6.18
- Have been used all possible pins of ATmega328 (Arduino Nano, Pro Mini)    
- Every text strings has been stored in flash memory to mantain a lot of free RAM memory
